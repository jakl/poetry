## The Barn Owl - by 9th grader me

When dusk fades,

As night wakes,

After the world drifts into sleep,

As nocturnal sense become keen,

The barn own floats, fetter less, from his nest.

.

When he’s had his meal,

As darkness creeps away,

Before light grows again,

As the world awakens,

He slips silently, sleepily back to bed.



## Ice Fissure

Slick, the descent

Glistening, the fall

Below a grand hall of frozen wet walls

Stalagmites, stalactites

Silent perils well behind

The journey continues;

Deep in a trench, fissured through glass

Long as an ocean current

Thin as a whisker

Though today, wide as a man

Deep as the cold

And deep as you dare



## Sandstorm

Lizard on the tusk of an angry desert rock

Sand grains beneath his scales

Hiss on the breeze

Dune says dim the lights please

All have been submerged



## Pirates

The sweat, glimmered like jewels on

The wiry mane, on the pirate's chest was like

The sun, today resembled a

Broiled tomato, was the last of the fruit

.

His gnarled fingers curled on

The sword, shimmering, hinting at reality

Hacks, in the treasure chest finally spilled

Gold, the color of his single front tooth

.

The crew, romped as if none had

Scurvy, staved off by oranges growing on

"Land HO!", called to extol finding islands

Green, groves of fruit, with booty! at last...

Me hearty



## Gargoyle

Time tics

Rock chips

Talons reflexively curl

Rested wings spread

Showers in lead

City nightlife below

Shaking head

Steps off ledge

Stone no longer binds him in place

Swoops of glee

Civilians flee

From this creature's wicked smile



## 8am & Prin-minded

Waiting, waiting

Brain dead and, waiting

My office locked

til 9 strikes the clock

to let in the sleepy me

.

Sleepy, sleepy

Pillow eyed, sleepy

Near, keys clacking

radio chatting

Break room stowaway me

.

Waiting, waiting

ecstatic, ELATED!

Flying in 4

towards the misipi & more

For people waiting for me



## History of a Moon Crater

Silence

Impact - billow of dust

Tidal wave cloud

Crystalline slow motion

Silence

Ice crystals fracture

Suspended, spinning

Feign a tinkling

Silence

Sphere to globe

Crater walls explode

In the breeze-less,

starlight

Silence



## Awareness

I live away with the setting sun

Making plans for sunrise when I will return

Home to mountains and fathomless caves

.

I live in a bed of roses, thorns well placed and paid for

Readying me, teaching me to tackle

The whirl of our real world

.

I live in someone else's dream

Searching for the moments to make my own

To prove that dreams are powerless

.

I live in monotony

Occasional gulps of air

But how I stare

...The trance is broken

There is life here



## Memory - first stanza written by a friend, last two by me

Walking down the road

Chain link fence on my side

Which side of the fence am I on?

Is it keeping me out, or protecting me from what is within?

Sunlight fading

Dusk has begun

Never know what would have been

Can't go back to how things were

Must move on somehow

.

A disheveled sky

Scraps of colored paper

Arranged into a Sunset nearby

Fence pierced by wincing moonlight

Who put it up and why?

It can be climbed

.

The side walk,

Meanders with me past, a dumpster

Slouches in rust by, the fence

Still ambiguous, faceless, reaching from, history

Can seem like a foe

Let it go



## Fractal

Tectonic plates thrust from the deep, aspiring to

Mountains, crumbling skywards, similar to their many

Crags, built of yet smaller

Boulders, made of

Stone chips, look like fractured tectonic plates

Fractal

Human mind

Developed from time,

The evolution of earth,

The mind is a globe,

Innumerable untapped depths

Infinite sides, spinning daily

Energy courses throughout, changes,

Each continent a designated flavor, a twist on the hot core -- personality

Able to cope with varieties of situations in reality

Cultivate, preserve, put to death pollution



## Bliss

Flowing bed of feathers beneath the cured wood

rock the boat, gently, in the fresh night

The sea flashes glinting smiles at the stars

What a pity it would be to sail over such happiness

Nestled in the safety of infinity

the one-man raft envisions nowhere else

knowing it is already at home



## Bottled Emotion

Where is the kaos, where is the storm

More than anything I'd ever witnessed form

These trances, I’m awake in awe

At the sheer magnitude of the maw

Of thoughts vortexing

Concentric on me



## Stargazing

I'm sitting on a Mario asteroid, watching stars fly by

Each one holds a different burst of thinking

Some are more fun, some hold more points

How do you rate a thought?



## Binary Stanzas

I have two waves crashing in my head

For easy visualization one is blue and one is red

One energizes me to do work and make life my own

One subtly encourages me to go to bed

.

One is obviously good and the other bad

The problem is, sides change depending on perspective

.

Where do I find the strength to topple the foundation of a wave?



## Genevieve

One of three leaves, fell in the post-summer breeze

Down but not out, because someone had the keys

By the ravine, we tu in darkness serene

Comrades we've found, now tell others the scene



## Gift

What's in a gift?

The intention behind, inside

Love, leaning, leaving

A landmark

Memory!

Gift: creative representation

From me to you

Of this

What to do, what to give?

*Bites lip*

Is it a gift to give you me,

daily happy me?

Gift: Planned surprise

Extraordinary!

To show I ...

To show, you are, to me ...

Precious



## Narnia

Whispering willows

& thistles of yellow

darts the fast rabbit tonight

.

Through the wardrobe & forest

the ice queen before us

Aslan! What terror & might!

.

Grab tar and fire

we'll incinerate her ire

Just save the creatures alright?

.

Now back to the land

forged by human hand

Victor! We've thwarted the fright.



## Flood in Muir Woods

Frog & Nematoad

in their mushroom abode

A dwelling, orange lit

by a hearth, or so it goes

.

They were weathering a storm

a flash flood of water, warm

In their fungi house so wobbly

glowing radiantly as it poured

.

At once they hear a *SKRIBPP*

Ho! Their foundation did rip

Off to see the great gully

Frog & Nematoad were swept



## Lava Lamp Genie is Free

Swirls sprouting colors

Spouting globules,

buttery bubbly butterflies

Whirlpool of sunken treasure

Oilpaint rainbow supernova

Tiedye flock of fat fish



## Skrillex

A million bees

with two million wings

Levitate the room

with everybody in it

.

Three million decibels

deep below Davy Jones's locker

Gush through the hall

breathing waterfalls of audio napálm

.

The overload maxed,

you stand there silent, alone

And then ....

the universe drops﻿



## Shoe

Slip soft tender tufts of cloth

until a spiffy bow takes form on your foot



## Faith

Pillars of light, blushing til sparks crest

Deep fright deep interest in the pulse of a breath

Slipping through shared constructs, shared fuel, radiating regardless

.

Walks into BART, asks, "How dat beat sway?"

Fixed on San Jose, asks me, "Fremont or Millbrae?"

Over to the enrapt artist, "You gonna be ok?"

The soul link in the sole blink of a construct we play

.

People of the moment, random access memories of time

Surfing the line connecting potential to rhythm and rhyme

.

Drenched by a chord, spun from silky sunbeams

Subtle typhoons permeate my rainbow dreams

Buoy taut on bedrock, pulled up by space-time poetry

Unleash it now, trail blaze the harmonic destiny



## Kooky

Overgrowth of forest, pawed by little bear mitts

Corduroy teddy midst, wonders of a verdant-gist

Ripples through the ecosystem, this toy misfortunately misplaced

Helped home by the native ones, to a child who feign did lose faith



## Maturing

Little minnow as you swim, barely notice your legs grow in

Barely notice your sky unfold, into a delicious insect world

Little minnow it's time to stand, fins aren't used up here on land



## Prayer to the Radish Spirit

Oh Radish Spirit

with your bristly man boobs

and pasty manilla skin

Your weird dropping gaze

on top 500lbs of starch

Your tiny radish loin cloth

with perhaps a straw hat

May you bless my radish farm

with stoic hardiness, now

and for generations to come



## Perspective

Little ant in the bark of your tree

how far do you see?

Do you see the thick foliage far overhead

or vast lagoons down paths rarely tread?

Or dino-breath clouds

glimmering gold in the sun

Oh what's that in your mouth

what have you won?

A chip of amber, so sweet just like honey

Nine times your size

worth more than any money

Climb on down to the roots of your tree

Today you done saw all ya'needed ta see

## Toilet Words

A shrine filled with sludge

Porcelain won't budge

'neath weight of my mass

Meals spew out my ass

Comfortable tight space

For minds to contemplate

Shitty Poetry

## Sunken Tree of Life

Yggdrasil of the ocean

  branches flowing with waves, in motion

.

Leaves, brilliant fluoresce

  a deep glowing trellis

.

Trunk plummets below

  into the dysphotic zone

.

Where creatures stir

  above aquatic fissure

.

From barnacle balconies

  play siren tonalities

.

And dainty denizens dance

  with wild things, entranced

.

Life, hidden submerged

  from Yggdrasil, has surged
